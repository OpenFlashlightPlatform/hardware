# Version 0.5

This is a prototype iteration, that has no battery charging features. It is so that I can work on the hardware and firmware in parallel.

It should in theory work for up to 160W COBs. I'll be testing that at a later stage.

The BOM is also available as a google doc here: https://goo.gl/zxzSkw
